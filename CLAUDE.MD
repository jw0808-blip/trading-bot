# CLAUDE.md - TraderJoes Firm Coding Standards

Reference this file for **all** coding tasks, agent prompts, and sub-bot development.

## Core Principles
- Always prioritize security — never expose keys, never log credentials.
- Use clear, consistent debug prints in every API call.
- Keep code simple and reliable for Render Background Worker.
- Log every mistake and correction to learnings/LEARNINGS.md.
- Follow SECURITY.md at all times.
- Never share credentials in prompts or code.

## For Trading Bots
- Use loaded environment variables for all platforms.
- Add clear debug prints for every API call.
- Keep !portfolio and !cycle simple and fast.
- Include all platforms (Kalshi, Robinhood, Polymarket, PredictIt, Interactive Brokers, Coinbase).
- Reference TRADING-GUIDE.md for risk management and EV rules.

## Agent Development Rules
- All sub-bots must be triggered by Discord commands (!research-crypto, !historian, etc.).
- Use structured responses with emojis and bold text for readability.
- Log improvements to LEARNINGS.md to make the system self-improving.
